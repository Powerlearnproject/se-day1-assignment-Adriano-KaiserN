Innovation is encouraged
Compliance and Industry Standards


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1The 1968 NATO CONFERENCE
The term "software engineering" was first formally introduced. The main agenda was the "software crisis", where software development was plagued by inefficiencies, cost overruns, and project failures. This Led to the development of structured programming and early software development methodologies.
2.RISE OF STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING 
Edsger Dijkstra published "Go To Statement Considered Harmful," where he campaigned for structured programming. Languages like C emerged, promoting structured programming concepts this therefore Introduced clear control structures such as loops improving code readability and maintainability.
3.AGILE METHODOLOGY IN 2001
This group emphasized on flexibility and iteractive development and it exists upto date
This enables user interaction and the system could be easily modified to meet user requirements.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
•  Planning
This is where the project scope is defined and explanations on how the system should be.
•  Requirements Analysis
Here the users and evenstakeholders are engaged on how the system should be, software documentation is done
•  Design
Here the system is designed including the user interface
•  Implementation (Coding)
The code to the system is written 
•  Testing
The users engage the system and if there are bugs then they are identified and corrected
•  Deployment
The software is released to user and they actively use and even trained on how to work with it
•  Maintenance & Support
ones the system is efficient its properly monitered ensuring a smooth flow and if there could be any updates then its done



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development. Each phase is completed before moving to the next while The Agile methodology is an iterative and flexible approach to software development. Instead of delivering the entire product at once, Agile breaks development into small, incremental releases.
Agile processes are flexible and iterative, whereas Waterfall processes are sequential and structured.
Agile operates in cycles, or sprints, with ongoing feedback, whereas Waterfall completes each phase before going on to the next.
Agile is very flexible in response to shifting needs, whereas Waterfall is inflexible and challenging to adjust after a phase is over.
Agile entails ongoing stakeholder collaboration, whereas Waterfall implies little interaction with customers until the finished product is delivered.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer (or Software Engineer) is responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining software applications.
Key Responsibilities:
Requirement Analysis: Understand project specifications and client needs.
Software Development: Write efficient, scalable, and maintainable code.
Debugging & Troubleshooting: Identify and fix software defects.
Code Review & Collaboration: 

A QA Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards and functions as intended before release.
Key Responsibilities:Test Planning & Design: Develop test plans, test cases, and test scripts.
Manual & Automated Testing: Perform functional, regression, performance, and security testing.
Bug Tracking & Reporting: Identify, log, and report bugs to developers.
Collaboration with Developers: Work closely with developers to resolve issues.
Ensure Compliance: 

A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of the software project, ensuring that it meets goals, deadlines, and budget constraints.
Key Responsibilities:Project Planning: Define project scope, goals, and timelines.
Resource Allocation: Assign tasks to team members based on skills and workload.
Risk Management: Identify potential risks and implement mitigation strategies.
Stakeholder Communication

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides comprehensive tools for writing, testing, and debugging code in a single interface.

Importance of IDEs in Software Development
Code Writing Efficiency: Offers features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and error detection.
Debugging Tools: Provides built-in debuggers to step through code and identify issues.
Project Management: Supports multi-file projects with better organization.
Integrated Build & Compilation: Simplifies compiling and running code.
Code Refactoring: Helps improve code structure with automated suggestions.
Plugin Support: Enhances functionality with extensions and integrations

Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
JetBrains CLion
Eclipse
PyCharm
 
A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that manages changes to source code over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate efficiently.

Importance of VCS in Software Development
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Maintains a history of code modifications for easy rollback.
Branching & Merging: Allows developers to experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase. 
Backup & Recovery: Protects against accidental loss or corruption of code.
Continuous Integration (CI/CD): Facilitates automated testing and deployment workflows.

Examples of Popular VCS Tools:
Git
SVN (Subversion)
Mercurial – Similar to Git but with a different approach to handling repositories.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Debugging and Fixing Complex Bugs
Challenge:Identifying the root cause of a bug can be time-consuming, especially in large codebases.
Bugs may only appear under specific conditions, making them difficult to reproduce.
Strategies:Use debugging tools (e.g., GDB for C++, Chrome DevTools for JavaScript).
 Implement logging and monitoring to track unexpected behavior.

 Managing Technical Debt
Challenge:Accumulating quick fixes or shortcuts leads to messy code, making future development harder.
Strategies: Use automated testing to detect issues before they accumulate. Encourage peer code reviews to maintain code quality.

 Time Management and Meeting Deadlines
Challenge:
Balancing multiple tasks, fixing bugs, and meeting deadlines can be overwhelming.
Strategies: Use time management techniques (e.g., Pomodoro, Eisenhower Matrix).
Break tasks into smaller, manageable milestones.

Working with Legacy Code
Challenge:Understanding and modifying old, poorly documented code can be difficult.
Strategies:Start by writing tests before making changes.
Refactor code in small, incremental updates rather than rewriting everything.

 Effective Communication & Team Collaboration
Challenge:Miscommunication between developers, designers, and stakeholders can lead to misunderstandings.
Strategies: Use collaboration tools like Slack, Confluence, and GitHub.
 Actively seek feedback and clarify doubts early.

 Security Risks & Data Protection
Challenge:
Software is vulnerable to security threats like SQL injections, XSS, and data breaches.
Strategies: Follow secure coding practices (e.g., input validation, encryption).
Use tools like OWASP ZAP for security testing.




Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing-ests individual components (functions, methods, or classes) of the software in isolation.
Importance:
Detects bugs at an early stage, reducing future debugging costs.
Ensures that each module works as expected before integration.
Facilitates refactoring and code changes with minimal risk.

intergration-Verifies that multiple units/modules work together as expected.
importance
Ensures data flow between modules is correct.
Detects issues in module interactions, such as incorrect data handling or communication failures.
Reduces defects related to integration issues.

system-Evaluates the entire software system as a whole to verify compliance with requirements.
importance
Confirms that all integrated components work as a complete system.
Identifies system-wide defects before deployment.
Ensures reliability, security, and performance.
typesFunctional Testing: Validates that the system meets functional requirements.
Performance Testing: Measures speed, scalability, and stability.
Security Testing tests security

acceptance-Determines whether the system meets business requirements and is ready for release
Validates that the software is ready for production use.
Identifies any last-minute issues before release.
Ensures user satisfaction and business requirement fulfillment.
types User Acceptance Testing (UAT): 
Operational Acceptance Testing 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models and elicit the most relevant, accurate, and useful responses.
Enhances AI Performance – Well-crafted prompts guide the AI to produce clear, precise, and relevant responses, reducing ambiguity and misinterpretation.
Improves Efficiency – A properly designed prompt minimizes the need for follow-up corrections or refinements, saving time and effort 
Facilitates Complex Tasks – Advanced prompt engineering techniques allow AI to generate creative content, write code
Reduces Bias and Errors – Thoughtful prompt design can mitigate AI biases by explicitly defining objective, neutral.
Optimizes User Experience – In applications like chatbots, search engines, and automated systems, well-structured prompts improve user interaction and satisfaction by yielding more intuitive and human-like responses.
Essential for AI Application Development – In fields like natural language processing (NLP), AI-driven automation, and generative AI, prompt engineering is key to building more reliable and intelligent systems.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
tell me more about technology is an example of a vague prompt
"Provide a brief overview of the impact of artificial intelligence on modern healthcare, including its benefits and challenges." this is an improved prompt
